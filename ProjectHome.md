Library to add infrared remote controller support to Arduino boards.

This is my first project, so don't expect something cool here. I'm just checking some stuff.

The second update is done and up. It has a better debug mode that will help you to get the remote controller protocol and will give you the needed defines for use it.

The debug mode is enabled adding `#define RemoteControlDebug` at the start of your project.

For more info, check the samples in wiki.
