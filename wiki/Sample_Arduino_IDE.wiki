With this sample, you can see the pressed button value in the serial monitor.

It uses the Arduino digital pin 12 for the infrared receiver.


= Code =

{{{
#include <RemoteControls.h>

RemoteControl rc(12,true); //Declaration using pin 12 and debug enabled

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(115200);    //Start serial communications
}

void loop(){
  rc.PressedButton();      //This returns the value. Now it's just shown via serial
}                          //nothing more is needed for that
}}}
