= Introduction =

With this sample, you can catch the remote controller protocol and get the needed defines for the library.
It uses the Arduino digital pin 12 for the infrared receiver.
Check the output using Atmel Studio's "Terminal Window" or Arduino IDE's "Monitor Serial" and follow the steps.

You must give a slightly lower values than the shown ones. I.E. for a 6100 starting pulse, send 5000.
For a 1540 pulse, send 1400 and for a 420, send 300.

After give a value, press a button many times till the next step is shown. Don't give 2 times the same value, unless you're sure that the last value was lost.

At the end, copy the given code at the start of your project. (Replacing the RemoteControlDebug's define)
