Arduino IDE has a bug with the defines and it makes useless the library as it is.
I recommend you to switch from ArduinoIDE to Atmel Studio 6.

Atmel Studio 6 can be downloaded for free at Atmel's website.
http://www.atmel.com/microsite/atmel_studio6/default.aspx

To set it up to work with Arduino, you can check the guides from JayconSystems.

If you want to use it on Arduino IDE anyway, you will need to edit the RemoteControls.h file.

To enable debug mode, uncomment line 12, from:
{{{//#define RemoteControlDebug	// ArduinoIDE users, uncomment to set debug mode}}}

to:
{{{#define RemoteControlDebug	// ArduinoIDE users, uncomment to set debug mode}}}

Then, get your needed values using the Sample_Debug_Mode.

Finally, replace the line 12 with your values and the library should be ready to use as any other.
If you have any problem, report it in Issues or sen an email.
